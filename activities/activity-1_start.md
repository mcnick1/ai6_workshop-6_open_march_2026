# Activity 1: Warm-Up — Curve Diagnosis

> ⏱️ **This is a warm-up — 15 minutes total.** There is nothing to install or submit. The goal is to arrive in the room, reconnect with your cohort, and start thinking.

> 📋 **Open your worksheet now:** This activity maps to **Part A** of [`Activity_Worksheet.md`](../handouts/Activity_Worksheet.md). Open it in your Jupyter file browser (left sidebar) or in a text editor alongside this file. You will record your curve diagnoses there — it is your evidence document for the day and feeds directly into Task 6.

**Primary KSB:** B3 — Acts inclusively when collaborating with people from technical and non-technical backgrounds. Contributing to knowledge sharing, management and empowerment across the broader team.

🎯 **Learning Objective:** Read training curves and begin connecting the diagnostic vocabulary to patterns you already recognise

## 📋 Expected Outputs

- A brief catch-up with your group
- Each curve matched to its most likely cause
- A one-sentence explanation of one unhealthy curve, suitable for a non-technical colleague

## 📝 Task 1 — Catch Up (5 minutes, groups of 2–4)

Spend no more than 5 minutes. Go round the group and answer one question each:

> "What have you been working on since the last workshop — in your job, not your coursework?"

No deep dives. The point is to reconnect and to notice the range of contexts in the room.

## 📝 Task 2 — Match the Curves (5 minutes, groups of 2–4)

Your coach will display the three training curve images from the `assets/` folder.

For each curve, agree as a group on the most likely cause before moving on.

| Curve | What you observe | Most likely cause |
|---|---|---|
| A |Train and validation loss both fall steadily and remain fairly close | healthy rate of learning/training |
| B |Both losses jump up and down heavily and eventually increase | overshooting updates |
| C |Both losses. Slow decreases |Low learning rate - steps too smal |

💡 **Tip:** Focus on what the *validation* line is doing relative to the *training* line — not just whether training loss is going down.

📋 **Thinking further (no image needed):** The worksheet has a fourth scenario — training loss barely moves at all, and *neither* does validation performance. This is a different failure mode from the three curves above: the model is not overfitting (validation is fine), it is simply not learning at all. What would you check first? Write your answer in **Question 4 of Part A** of the [Activity Worksheet](../handouts/Activity_Worksheet.md). Common causes include a learning rate so low the weights barely update, a frozen layer that should be trainable, or a bug in the training loop.

✅ **Checkpoint:** You have a written cause for each curve, and a written answer to Question 4, before your coach reveals the answers.

## 📝 Task 3 — What Felt Familiar? (3 minutes)

Your coach will have just shown a slide with examples of these same three patterns appearing outside machine learning — in medicine, economics, sport, and management.

Look back at those examples. Without hunting for a perfect parallel, answer this question as a group:

> "Which of those examples felt closest to something you've encountered in your own work — and why?"

You do not need a technically precise match. A rough recognition is enough. Share briefly; one sentence each if time is short.

📘 **Why this matters:** The patterns you are about to see in a training loop — too cautious, too aggressive, and just right — are not ML-specific. Recognising them in your own domain means you will have stronger intuitions when you see them in the notebook, and you will be able to explain them more naturally to colleagues who do not have an ML background.

---

## 📝 Task 4 — Plain Language Explanation (2 minutes)

Choose **one** of the unhealthy curves. Write one or two sentences explaining what is happening and what you would recommend — addressed to a non-technical colleague, with no jargon.

> _______________________________________________________________

📘 **B3 note:** The goal is not to simplify — it is to translate accurately, so the other person can participate in the decision rather than just defer to you. A good explanation gives them something actionable.
